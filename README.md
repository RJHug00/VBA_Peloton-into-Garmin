Microsoft 365 (nee MS Office) VBA logic to download a Peloton bike ride, convert it into a FIT file, and upload it to Garmin Connect. This can eliminate the need for a Strava account obtained solely as a means to get Peloton data into Garmin.  **NOT for Peloton treadmill and other types of workouts.**

Please refer to this repository's Wiki for detailed download and setup instructions.

Ride on!
