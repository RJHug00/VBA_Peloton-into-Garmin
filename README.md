Microsoft 365 (nee MS Office) Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code to download a Peloton bike ride and convert it into a FIT file suitable for upload to Garmin Connect. If you obtained a Strava account solely as a means to get Peloton data into Garmin, it won't be needed anymore. Recording your Peloton rides on your Garmin watch might become optional too. **NOT for other types of Peloton workouts, and does not currently work on Apple devices**.

Please refer to this repository's [Wiki](https://github.com/RJHug00/VBA_Peloton-into-Garmin/wiki#introduction) for detailed download and setup instructions.

**Ride on!**
