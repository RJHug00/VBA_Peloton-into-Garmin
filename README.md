Microsoft 365 (nee MS Office) Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code to download a Peloton bike ride, convert it into a FIT file, and upload it to Garmin Connect. This can eliminate the need for a Strava account obtained solely as a means to get Peloton data into Garmin. It can also eliminate the need to record Peloton rides on your Garmin watch. **NOT for other types of Peloton workouts, and does not currently work on Apple devices**

Please refer to this repository's Wiki for detailed download and setup instructions.

**Ride on!**
